Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course Objective
----------------

Transportation Policy, Strategy and Management is a survey course of current concepts, theory and issues in the strategic management of transportation organizations. Designed for graduate transportation, logistics, planning and engineering systems students, the objective of this course is to provide students with an overview of the operating context, leadership challenges, strategies and management tools that are used in today's public and private transportation organizations. As transportation operations occur within an environment where the roles of public and private organizations are often blurred, this course focuses on the patterns of conflict and consensus between government and industry in transportation. The following concepts, approaches and issues are presented: alternative models of decision making, strategic planning (e.g., use of SWOT analysis and scenario development), stakeholder valuation and analysis, government-business regulation and cooperation within the transportation enterprise, disaster communications, change management and the impact of globalization.

Course Requirements
-------------------

Each class meeting will be a combination of lectures and group discussions. Lectures will integrate the assigned readings and other materials. Group discussion will examine a particular case, apply the concepts contained within the readings and integrate the lecture materials.

Students are expected to attend all classes and meaningfully contribute to group discussions. Readings are to be completed for the day they are listed. Students are responsible for being able to discuss specific policy problems in the context of the readings. Attendance and the quality of class participation will account for 10 percent of the final grade and will be considered in borderline grade cases.

Written work includes two 15-page papers. The first paper will provide policy analysis to a senior transportation official in government regarding a specific policy problem. The second paper will advise an executive in a private firm about a problem that could have global implications for their business. Assignments will be given in class. Each paper will be 45 percent of the final grade. Grading criteria includes demonstrating an understanding of the case material, integration and application of lecture and reading concepts, and the quality of written presentation.
